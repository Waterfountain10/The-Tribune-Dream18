# MUPSS Photography Website

## Overview
This website was created for the McGill University Photography Society (MUPSS). As the web developer for The Tribune, I collaborated with MUPSS to showcase the artwork of one of their photographers, Abby, in a personalized website.

The site highlights Abby's photography and provides an engaging platform for visitors to explore her art. The website was designed using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and some JavaScript.
